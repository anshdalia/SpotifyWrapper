# Setup Instructions:
add the env file from discord to the project root and rename it to .env (add a period at the front). Don't leak it because 
it contains the Django secret key and we are planning on hosting publicly in the future so security is important.

# Development:
When pushing local changes to the git hub always push to a new branch and then merge to main later.

# Design Mock Ups:
Here is a link to webpage design examples:
