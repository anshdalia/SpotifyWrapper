# Setup Instructions:
add the .env file from discord to the project root (file that contains manage.py). Don't leak it because it
contains the Django secret key and we are planning on hosting publicly in the future so security is important.

# Development:
When pushing local changes to the git hub always push to a new branch and then merge to main later.

# Design Mock Ups:
